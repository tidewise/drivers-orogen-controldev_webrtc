  <description brief="A package to generate a `controldev/RawCommand` output port through joystick messages received from WebRTC data channel">
  The component receives a JSON from a WebRTC peer, with `axis` and `buttons` attributes as in the Standard Gamepad from JS Gamepad library but with just the values at those fields. Also, the received JSON has a boolean `status` field with true indicating that it should write the command to the port. Note, the task just writes at `raw_command_port` when receives a message.

Finally, for each received message the task sends a message back to its peer with a JSON containing just a `result` field. That field receives true when the received message has all the attributes and was decoded translated correctly to `controldev/RawCommand` type being able to write at the port, and receives false otherwise. Note that the task just keeps connection with one peer, the lastest connected one.
